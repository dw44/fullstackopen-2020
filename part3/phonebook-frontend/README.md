This application covers the frontend half of the project spanning exercises 3.1 - 3.22 of Part-3 of the 'Fullstack Open' (https://fullstackopen.com/en).

At this point, all exercises for part-3 from 3.1 through 3.22 have been completed.

ESLint was installed and used in the front end part of the application but since it was causing conflicts with create-react-app's dependencies, it, alongwith its configuration files, was removed after the code was linted. CRA's dependencies include an older version of ESLint which remains installed. For this project, a modified version of airbnb style guide was used.

The current state of this project is as it should be at the conclusion of exercise 3.22.

## Link to application deployed for exercise 3.10 and 3.11
## Updated version deployed for 3.21, replaced with linted build from exercise 3.22
