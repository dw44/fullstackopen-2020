This application covers the backend half of the project spanning exercises 3.1 - 3.22 of Part-3 of the 'Fullstack Open' (https://fullstackopen.com/en).

At this point, all exercises for part-3 from 3.1 through 3.22 have been completed.

A custom version of airbnb style guide configuration was used for ESLint. Some rules were changed to avoid breaking the code since working around them would have been counterproductive. 

The current state of this project is as it should be at the conclusion of exercise 3.22.

## Up to date app deployed to Heroku as of exercise 3.22
