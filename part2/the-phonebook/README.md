This application covers exercises 2.6 - 2.11, and 2.15 - 2.20 of Part-2 of the 'Fullstack Open' (https://fullstackopen.com/en).

At this point, exercises 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18, 2.19, and 2.20 have been completed. Certain exercises required overwriting code written for previous exercises.

Styles, which are irrelevant to exercises prior to 2.19, were added for my own convenience. The main div in the app component has a className attribute for this reason, and the display component is encapsulated in a 'section' tag instead of div to facilitate styling. Styles for the messages displayed in exercises 2.19 and 2.20 have been added to existing CSS for the project.

The event handler function has several branching paths so it has been heavily commented in order to make it easier to follow it's various conditional branches. Some of it's functionality from previous commits has been offloaded to helper functions but it remains quite large nonetheless. In terms of functionality, it does everything it should at the conclusion of part 2 / exercise 2.20.

The final state of this project is as it should be at the conclusion of exercise 2.20.
