This application covers the frontend half of the project spanning exercises 5.1 - 5.16 of Part-5 of the 'Fullstack Open' (https://fullstackopen.com/en). The backend built over the course of part 4 was used for this part.

At this point, all exercise from 5.1 through 5.16 have been completed. 

For exercise 5.10, functionality to delete a blog entry was already included in the exercises submitted for part 4, along with the relevent authorization checks.

Following exercise 5.16, a copy of the backend for the bloglist application was moved to the repo for part-5 even though part-5 doesn't explicitly cover the backend. This was done to avoid making changes to the already submitted repo for part4, where the backend was originally stored.

For exercise 5.12, a custom version of the airbnb eslint configuration was used.

The current state of this project is as it should be at the conclusion of exercise 5.16.
