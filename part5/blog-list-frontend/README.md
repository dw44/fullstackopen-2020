This application covers the frontend half of the project spanning exercises 5.1 - 5.12 of Part-5 of the 'Fullstack Open' (https://fullstackopen.com/en). The backend built over the course of part 4 was used for this part.

At this point, all exercise from 5.1 through 5.12 have been completed. 

For exercise 5.10, functionality to delete a blog entry was already included in the exercises submitted for part 4, along with the relevent authorization checks.

For exercise 5.12, a custom version of the airbnb eslint configuration was used.

The current state of this project is as it should be at the conclusion of exercise 5.12.
